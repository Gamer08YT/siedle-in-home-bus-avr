# siedle-in-home-bus-avr
Atmel AVR compatible library implementing an interface to the Siedle "in-home-bus", which Siedle uses in many of their door intercom systems. Example circuits necessary for the physical interface included. Thx to the users of the mikrocontroller.net forum for finding the right load resistor values.

This circuit provides a physical interface to the bus:
